# RandomUser APP

In this application, I have used the following tools

- javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- React

### Description

My goal in this project is to receieve a data from an end point and display the results using react components. I have used "https://randomuser.me/" api to generate a random user. Although I should mention the general look of the web page wasn't my priority.
